As the majority (70%) of the EU-housing stock is owner occupied and largely consists of single family dwellings it is understandable that many countries focus their energy saving policies on homeowners. Complementary to the national policy frameworks, regional and local authorities implement locally based policy instruments targeting specific groups and individual homeowners. In order to enlarge the effectiveness of their policy instruments and to reach the energy saving goals, frontrunner local authorities in particular are searching for ways to reach homeowners. Consultancy centres and pop-ups can be a way to make individual homeowners more aware about their energy use and stimulate them to apply low carbon technologies. The research results not only show that a wide range of business models are available to develop, structure and organise these consultation centres and pop-ups, but also that they indeed could play an important role in accelerating the energy performance of owner occupied housing.

Natural fibers are considered to be renewable, biodegradable, and ecofriendly, and have been applied to be used as alternative reinforcements to traditional glass fibers for polymer based composites (GFRP). Natural fiber reinforced polymer (NFRP) composites have been found to be manufactured as secondary structures or interior parts of aircrafts or automobiles. In this paper, a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) study was performed to demonstrate the possible advantages of ramie fiber on environmental impacts and to provide fundamental data for the further assessment of ramie fiber reinforced polymers (RFRP) and its structures. By collecting the material inventories of the production process of ramie fiber, the environmental impacts of ramie fiber (characterized by eight main impact categories, which are climate change, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, human toxicity potential, ozone depletion, photochemical oxidant creation, freshwater ecotoxicity, and fossil depletion) were calculated and compared with that of glass fiber. Found if spinning process is ignored within the production of the ramie fiber, ramie fiber exhibits better ozone depletion and they have almost the same values of climate change and terrestrial acidification in terms of glass fiber. However, if the spinning process is included, ramie fiber only performs better in terms of ozone depletion. And degumming and carding and spinning processes are the processes that cause more pollution.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Motor vehicles. Aeronautics.

In prior work, a dynamic model validated against steady-state data from a 605 MW subcritical power plant was presented. This power plant model was used as a test-bed for dynamic simulations, in which the coal load was regulated to satisfy a varying power demand. Plant-level control regulated the plant load to match an anticipated trajectory of the power demand. The efficiency of the power plant&rsquo;s operation at varying loads was optimized through a supervisory control architecture that performs set point optimization on the regulatory controllers. Dynamic optimization problems were formulated to search for optimal time-varying input trajectories that satisfy operability and safety constraints during the transition between plant states. An improvement in time-averaged efficiency of up to 1.8% points was shown to be feasible with corresponding savings in coal consumption of 184.8 tons/day and a carbon footprint decrease of 0.035 kg/kWh.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Chemistry", "code": "QD1-999"}]}, "created_date": "2018-08-06T07:18:08Z"}, {"last_updated": "2018-08-06T07:18:08Z", "id": "7f234bae18fd4b97aeb11aea44b426c3", "bibjson": {"start_page": "63", "author": [{"affiliation": "Unit for Health Promotion Research, University of Southern Denmark, 6700 Esbjerg, Denmark", "name": "Charlotte Lassen Olesen"}, {"affiliation": "Unit for Health Promotion Research, University of Southern Denmark, 6700 Esbjerg, Denmark", "name": "Leena Eklund Karlsson"}], "journal": {"publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://www.mdpi.com/journal/societies/about", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "Societies", "country": "CH", "number": "3", "volume": "8", "issns": ["2075-4698"]}, "title": "Roma Representation in Danish Roma Policy and Public Discourse\u2014A Critical Analysis", "month": "8", "link": [{"url": "http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/8/3/63", "type": "fulltext", "content_type": "pdf"}], "year": "2018", "keywords": ["critical discourse analysis", "Roma people", "representation", "newspaper", "public policy", "public health", "social inclusion", "social determinants of health"], "identifier": [{"type": "eissn", "id": "2075-4698"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.3390/soc8030063"}], "abstract": "Imagined stereotypes of Roma are prevailing across Europe and have an impact of discrimination and social exclusion of the Roma.

Under the optimized conditions, the cumulative nitrogen release rate of the biochar-based fertilizer was 17.63%, which was significantly lower than that of ordinary fertilizer. Elementary analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy proved that UHP attached to the porous structures of the biochar.

In this review, we summarize the health effects and exposure assessment of methylmercury as follows: (1) methylmercury toxicity, (2) history and background of Minamata disease, (3) methylmercury pollution in the Minamata area according to analyses of preserved umbilical cords, (4) changes in the sex ratio in Minamata area, (5) neuropathology in fetuses, (6) kinetics of methylmercury in fetuses, (7) exposure assessment in fetuses.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Chemical technology", "code": "TP1-1185"}]}, "created_date": "2018-08-06T07:18:07Z"}, {"last_updated": "2018-08-06T07:17:59Z", "id": "3fb047403bd646f59cc749256fd598b6", "bibjson": {"start_page": "574", "author": [{"affiliation": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S3 7RH, UK", "name": "Eun-jin Kim"}], "journal": {"publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy/about", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "Entropy", "country": "CH", "number": "8", "volume": "20", "issns": ["1099-4300"]}, "title": "Investigating Information Geometry in Classical and Quantum Systems through Information Length", "month": "8", "link": [{"url": "http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/20/8/574", "type": "fulltext", "content_type": "pdf"}], "year": "2018", "keywords": ["stochastic processes", "Langevin equation", "Fokker\u2013Planck equation", "information length", "Fisher information", "relaxation", "chaos", "attractor", "probability density function"], "identifier": [{"type": "eissn", "id": "1099-4300"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.3390/e20080574"}], "abstract": "Stochastic processes are ubiquitous in nature and laboratories, and play a major role across traditional disciplinary boundaries.

However, the existing research is mainly focused on the performance prediction methodologies for projects, while the research pertaining to programs has concentrated on identifying the qualitative critical success factors (CSFs). Thus, this study developed a methodology for predicting the program performance. Forty-five CSFs were identified herein from literature review and expert interviews, then grouped through factor analysis. In addition, the Program Definition Rating Index (PgDRI) was developed by calculating the weights of the proposed CSFs through structured equation modeling in order to evaluate the quantitative program performance. For validation, the PgDRI was applied to three in-progress cases, and the PgDRI scores were compared with the actual performance of each case. The PgDRI developed in this study can contribute to the body of knowledge pertaining to program management by quantifying the performance management of a program. In addition, the PgDRI can be utilized in the performance management of a program in terms of the cost and schedule by allowing practitioners to apply the PgDRI repeatedly to the major decision-making processes during the early stages of a program.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Environmental effects of industries and plants", "code": "TD194-195"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Renewable energy sources", "code": "TJ807-830"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Environmental sciences", "code": "GE1-350"}]}, "created_date": "2018-08-06T07:18:34Z"}, {"last_updated": "2018-08-06T07:18:41Z", "id": "b0685a3f97864679ba3a1cc89273109b", "bibjson": {"start_page": "2749", "author": [{"affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China", "name": "Qi Wang"}, {"affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China", "name": "Fenzhen Su"}, {"affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China", "name": "Yu Zhang"}, {"affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China", "name": "Huiping Jiang"}, {"affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China", "name": "Fei Cheng"}], "journal": {"publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability/about", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "Sustainability", "country": "CH", "number": "8", "volume": "10", "issns": ["2071-1050"]}, "title": "Morphological Precision Assessment of Reconstructed Surface Models for a Coral Atoll Lagoon", "month": "8", "link": [{"url": "http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/8/2749", "type": "fulltext", "content_type": "pdf"}], "year": "2018", "keywords": ["coral atoll reefs", "lagoon", "geomorphological evolution", "morphological reconstruction", "surface model", "morphological precision assessment"], "identifier": [{"type": "eissn", "id": "2071-1050"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.3390/su10082749"}], "abstract": "In addition to remote-sensing monitoring, reconstructing morphologic surface models through interpolation is an effective means to reflect the geomorphological evolution, especially for the lagoons of coral atolls, which are underwater.

In particular, it is interesting to simultaneuously calculate the possible pressurization of the pipe network and the surface water dynamics in case of overflow.

The surface flow model is based on two-dimensional shallow water equations with which it is possible to solve the overland water dynamics as well as the transformation of rainfall into runoff through different submodels of infiltration. The underground drainage system assumes mostly free surface flow that can be pressurized in specific situations. The pipe network is modeled by means of one-dimensional sections coupled with the surface model in specific regions of the domain, such as drains or sewers. The numerical techniques considered for the resolution of both mathematical models are based on finite volume schemes with a first-order upwind discretization.

In the lungs, it is a well-established opsonin that can agglutinate a range of microbes, and enhance their clearance via phagocytosis and super-oxidative burst. It can interfere with allergen\u2013IgE interaction and suppress basophil and mast cell activation. However, it is now becoming evident that SP-D is likely to be an innate immune surveillance molecule against tumor development. SP-D has been shown to induce apoptosis in sensitized eosinophils derived from allergic patients and a leukemic cell line via p53 pathway. Recently, SP-D has been shown to suppress lung cancer progression via interference with the epidermal growth factor signaling. In addition, a truncated form of recombinant human SP-D has been reported to induce apoptosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma via Fas-mediated pathway in a p53-independent manner. To further establish a correlation between SP-D presence/levels and normal and cancer tissues, we performed a bioinformatics analysis, using Oncomine dataset and the survival analysis platforms Kaplan\u2013Meier plotter, to assess if SP-D can serve as a potential prognostic marker for human lung cancer, in addition to human gastric, breast, and ovarian cancers. We also analyzed immunohistochemically the presence of SP-D in normal and tumor human tissues. We conclude that (1) in the lung, gastric, and breast cancers, there is a lower expression of SP-D than normal tissues; (2) in ovarian cancer, there is a higher expression of SP-D than normal tissue; and (3) in lung cancer, the presence of SP-D could be associated with a favorable prognosis. On the contrary, at non-pulmonary sites such as gastric, breast, and ovarian cancers, the presence of SP-D could be associated with unfavorable prognosis. Correlation between the levels of SP-D and overall survival requires further investigation. Our analysis involves a large number of dataset; therefore, any trend observed is reliable. Despite apparent complexity within the results, it is evident that cancer tissues that produce less levels of SP-D compared to their normal tissue counterparts are probably less susceptible to SP-D-mediated immune surveillance mechanisms via infiltrating immune cells.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Immunologic diseases.

The presence of myocardial inflammation is not specific to viral myocarditis or other forms of acute myocardial injury, and the regional distribution within the myocardium helps differentiate acute myocarditis from other diseases. The currently recommended diagnostic criteria (Lake Louise Criteria) include markers for hyperemia/capillary leak, edema, and inflammatory scarring.

We survey the state-of-the-art FC analysis methods including widely used static functional connectivity (SFC) and more recently proposed dynamic functional connectivity (DFC). Temporal correlations among regions of interest (ROIs), data-driven spatial network and functional network connectivity (FNC) are often computed to reflect SFC from different angles. SFC can be extended to DFC using a sliding-window framework, and intrinsic connectivity states along the time-varying connectivity patterns are typically extracted using clustering or decomposition approaches. We also briefly summarize window-less DFC approaches. Subsequently, we highlight various strategies for feature selection including the filter, wrapper and embedded methods. In terms of model building, we include traditional classifiers as well as more recently applied deep learning methods. Moreover, we review representative applications with remarkable classification accuracy for psychosis and mood disorders, neurodevelopmental disorder, and neurological disorders using fMRI data.

The data consists of the names of around 60 key cities like Birmingham, Brighton, Cambridge, Chester, Derby, Essex, Exeter, Glasgow, London, Manchester, Oxford, Queensville, York, etc. The results clearly show that all such names have true Arabic cognates, with the same or similar forms and meanings whose different forms, however, are all found to be due to natural and plausible causes and different courses of linguistic change. Furthermore, they show that place names play an important role in both near and distant genetic relationships. As a consequence, the results indicate, contrary to Comparative Method and Family-Tree Model claims (e.g. Campbell 2013; Harper 2012-18), that Arabic, English, and all Indo-European languages belong to the same language, let alone the same family. Therefore, they prove the adequacy of the consonantal radical theory in relating English, German, French, Latin, and Greek to Arabic as their origin all because, unlike any other language in the group, it shares cognates with all of them in addition to its huge linguistic repertoire phonetically, phonologically, morphologically, syntactically, and semantically.", "title": "THE ARABIC ORIGINS OF ENGLISH AND EUROPEAN \"PLACE NAMES\": A CONSONANTAL RADICAL THEORY APPROACH", "month": "6", "link": [{"url": "https://journal.uniku.ac.id/index.php/ERJEE/article/view/1244/963", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2018", "keywords": ["Place names", "Arabic", "English", "German", "French", "Russian", "Latin", "Greek", "Sanskrit", "historical linguistics", "consonantal radical/lexical root theory"], "identifier": [{"type": "doi", "id": "10.25134/erjee.v6i2.1244"}, {"type": "pissn", "id": "2301-7554"}, {"type": "eissn", "id": "2541-3643"}], "journal": {"publisher": "University of Kuningan and Association of Indonesian Scholars of English Education (AISEE)", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "https://journal.uniku.ac.id/index.php/ERJEE/about/submissions#authorGuidelines", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY-NC-ND", "title": "CC BY-NC-ND"}], "title": "English Review: Journal of English Education", "country": "ID", "number": "2", "volume": "6", "issns": ["2301-7554", "2541-3643"]}, "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Education (General)", "code": "L7-991"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "English language", "code": "PE1-3729"}]}, "created_date": "2018-08-06T08:23:17Z"}, {"last_updated": "2018-08-06T08:19:00Z", "id": "e93848868304401a8041560409cff83a", "bibjson": {"author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Population Health , Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia", "name": "Anis Fuad"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Information Management, National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan", "name": "Chien-Yeh Hsu"}], "journal": {"publisher": "F1000 Research Ltd", "license": [{"url": "http://f1000research.com/about", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "language": ["EN"], "title": "F1000Research", "country": "GB", "volume": "7", "issns": ["2046-1402"]}, "title": "UTAUT for HSS: initial framework to study health IT adoption in the developing countries [version 1; referees: 2 approved]", "month": "1", "link": [{"url": "https://f1000research.com/articles/7-101/v1", "type": "fulltext", "content_type": "html"}], "year": "2018", "identifier": [{"type": "pissn", "id": "2046-1402"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.12688/f1000research.13798.1"}], "abstract": "Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is an integrative concept that has been used widely to measure IT adoption.

Activation of TLRs is becoming or has been a target for cancer treatment. It is shown that TLRs can induce preferable anti-tumor effect by eliciting inflammatory cytokines expression and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) response. As adjuvant, TLRs agonists can launch a strong immune response to assist cancer radiotherapy and bio-chemotherapy. On the other hand, tumor-associated antigens acting as PAMPs, can also activate TLRs and induce tumor gene-related programmed cell death, including apoptosis, autophagy and programmed necrosis. While there are also arguments that the excessive TLRs expression will promote tumor deterioration in various organisms, as the TLR-induced inflammation will accelerate the cancer cells boost in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the effect of TLRs acting on cancers is still not quite clear today.

In addressing this issue, evidence-based strategies of livestock development with regard to the provisions of Agriculture of the Kyrgyz Republic and the possibility of further development. Described a gradual increase in competitive pressure of foreign manufacturers that supply to our market is cheaper, various products. The current policy in relation to agriculture may improve the situation and lead to an increase in poverty in particular farmer (peasant) farms. One of the most important groups of problems in the development of agriculture creates small size of land holdings of farmers, the low level of land consolidation. Weak production capacity is an important factor that complicates the access to financial resources and, accordingly, the possibility of acquiring the market for goods and services that are used in the production process (fuel, fertilizer, machinery, services, veterinary services, etc.). Numerous efforts to build agricultural cooperatives, agro-industrial clusters, co-operatives and agricultural processing industry and trade were not successful and did not give the expected results. The combination of these problems as well as environmental factors creates a set of problems that hinder the growth of output and efficiency of agriculture and livestock sub-sector.

School agriculture is one of the subjects which require teachers who as the principal implementers of the curriculum must be able to interpret agriculture curriculum objectives to meet societal needs. However, implementation of agriculture curriculum in Arid and Semi Arid Land (ASAL) secondary schools has fallen short of its expectations as it has not significantly influenced agricultural activities both in school and surrounding communities. Thus, the benefit of implementing agriculture curriculum in ASALs is yet to be fully achieved. The research sought to document the teacher factors influencing implementation of secondary school agriculture curriculum in ASAL schools in Kenya. The research focused on teacher training, teacher technical knowledge and skills about Dry Land Agriculture [DLA] practices and training and support. The research was carried out in ASAL counties of Baringo, Makueni and Narok. Survey research design was used. The researcher developed a semi-structured questionnaire to obtain data on the teacher factors from 88 agriculture teachers. The research results showed that most teachers were trained and professionally qualified thus expected to translate the curriculum objectives to learning activities relevant to ASALS. However, agriculture teachers were found to be deficient in terms of technical knowhow on DLA practices among them, insitu water harvesting and use of sunken beds. Agriculture teachers received insufficient support towards professional development. The support did not aim at DLA knowledge and skill enhancement towards agriculture curriculum implementation. Agriculture teachers\u2019 inadequacy on DLA practices\u2019 technical knowhow and lack of support towards professional development was impacting negatively on agriculture curriculum implementation in ASAL schools. The Government has a responsibility of ensuring that all ASAL schools are staffed with qualified teacher. Secondary school administrations in ASALs need to support teachers on continuous trainings that are relevant to agriculture curriculum implementation. Agriculture training program developers need to focus more on the acquisition of technical know on all DLA practices. Addressing the training inadequacies among agriculture teachers in ASAL schools will lead to a competent staff who can translate curriculum objectives into learning experiences that promote DLA in ASALs. This translation will in turn influence agricultural activities both in school and in the society for improved agricultural production.", "title": "TEACHERS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PRACTICAL

This covers a broad range of problems of country, regional and global scale, put forward and voiced conflicting estimates and judgments. Abroad, actively promoted the interpretation of the \u201creturn\u201d of Russia to the continent as a new direction of neo-imperial ambitions of the new Russia and its aspirations to weaken the position of the West, \u201cgolden\u201d its image in the developing countries, in the eyes of Africans. Author analyzes the impact of the emerging political, economic and social realities of the XXI century on the development prospects of the African continent in general, and on the Russian-African relations in particular. The author concludes that the increase in the weight and role of the continent in world politics and economy today requires a rethinking of the Russian approaches to the problems of scale Russian-African partnership and the formation of its long-term vision, building on the existing political, diplomatic and investment and the country's financial resources. The new dynamics of Russian-African relations is connected, first of all, with the development of partnerships in those areas where Russia has competitive potential, production capacities, high competence and experience. Including the development of natural resources, nuclear power and hydropower, military-technical cooperation, the establishment of satellite information and communication systems, cooperation in the sphere of education, health, the fight against epidemics, natural catastrophes. Russia is confident enough to overcome the deep recession of relations with Africa, recorded in the late 80's and 90-ies of XX century. However, it would be premature to claim that full-blooded \u201creturn\u201d of Russia to the continent has already taken place. Scaling up comprehensive cooperation will depend, first, on the quality of the stability of the acceleration of development in Africa, the transformation of African economies to modern industrial and technological bases; and, secondly, on the dynamics of socio-economic and socio-political development of the Russian state.

The subject of research is the positions of the \u201cthink tanks\u201d of the USA, Great Britain, Germany and France. Among a large number of the regional conflicts in the CIS the authors focused attention on the conflicts in the East of Ukraine, in Transnistria and in the Nagorno-Karabakh. Such selection is explained by the acute character and impact of these conflicts on the interests of Russia and the other leading states and the international organizations. The theoretical and methodological background of the article consists of the approaches and methods, which are used by the modern political science for the comprehensive analysis of the architecture and structure of the international relations, the mechanism of formation and functioning of the certain states\u2019 foreign policy. The research has the cross-disciplinary character and is made at the intersection of such disciplines as history, political science, conflictology and the international relations. The authors reveal positions of the western \u201cthink tanks\u201d on the genesis, evolution and the potential settlement of the armed conflicts in the CIS region. The article highlights the estimates of the western \u201cthink tanks\u201d of the reasons of the \u201cfrozen\u201d conflicts on the post-USSR space, of the Russian Federation\u2019s role and the participation of external actors (the EU and the USA) in their settlement. Giving the research of the approaches of the western expert analytical centers, the authors reach a conclusion about a set course of the western political scientists\u2019 estimates. It reflects in assignment of a unilateral responsibility for a conflict inhaling or its unleashing on Russia, or on the party of a conflict, closed to the official Moscow. It is particularly obvious in the Ukrainian crisis: the Western countries consider our state as its main initiator.
