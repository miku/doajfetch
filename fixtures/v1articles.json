We demonstrate that overexpression of dynamitin, which is known to dissociate dynein from microtubules, and treatment with microtubule-disrupting drugs inhibits nuclear accumulation of NF-kappaB p65 and reduces NF-kappaB-dependent transcription activity.

Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, plaster casts of edentulous maxillae of 40 DS infants (20 females and 20 males, aged 221.3 \u00b1 132.4 days) and 40 CG infants (20 females and 20 males, aged 53.9 \u00b1 87.2 days) were digitized and converted into 3-dimensional stereolithography data. An automated landmark- and investigator-independent method for assessing two-dimensional measurements such as width, depth, and length of palate, as well as palatal index and the 3-dimensional volume, were used.Matching DS and healthy CG infants by age, we found reduced sizes in all linear and volumetric measurements in the DS group. Matching both groups by palatal volume, we found no differences between the groups according to palatal width (p = .93), palatal depth (p = .32), and palatal index (p = .31). Control infants with the same palatal volume compared with the DS infants were about 151 days younger, 95%-CI = [102, 200] (Hodges-Lehmann estimator). Except for palatal length and palatal volume, the growth pattern of DS palates decreased irregularly at age 6 to 9 months.The palate of DS infants in the first 6 to 9 month of life is of normal shape but considerably smaller compared with healthy normals. From 6 to 9 months onward, the growth pattern of the hard palate in DS infants decreases irregularly. High-arch-constricted palates could, therefore, be interpreted as secondarily acquired in later life. We therefore speculate that it could be advantageous to begin oral muscular stimulating therapy between 6 and 9 months of age which may prevent palatal shape alterations and enhance oral function which also contributes to maxillary development.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2017-11-12T03:00:11Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:27:47Z", "id": "5116f62e819c4b3d8962f34c460f0fd6", "bibjson": {"start_page": "e51705", "author": [{"name": "Shuyi Chen"}, {"name": "Brandy Lewis"}, {"name": "Andrea Moran"}, {"name": "Ting Xie"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Public Library of Science (PLoS)", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "PLoS ONE", "country": "US", "number": "12", "volume": "7", "issns": ["1932-6203"]}, "title": "Cadherin-mediated cell adhesion is critical for the closing of the mouse optic fissure.", "month": "0", "link": [{"url": "http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3519883?pdf=render", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2012", "identifier": [{"type": "eissn", "id": "1932-6203"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051705"}], "abstract": "Coloboma is a congenital disease that contributes significantly to childhood blindness. It results from the failure in closing the optic fissure, a transient opening on the ventral side of the developing eye. Although human and mouse genetic studies have identified a number of genes associated with coloboma, the detailed cellular mechanisms underlying the optic fissure closure and coloboma formation remain largely undefined. N-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion has been shown to be important for the optic fissure closure in zebrafish, but it remains to be determined experimentally how cell-cell adhesions are involved in the mammalian optic fissure closing process. \u03b1-Catenin is required for cell adhesion mediated by all of the classic cadherin molecules, including N-cadherin. In this study, we used the Cre-mediated conditional knockout technique to specifically delete \u03b1-catenin from the developing mouse eye to show that it is required for the successful closing of the optic fissure. In \u03b1-catenin conditional mutant optic cups, the major cell fates, including the optic fissure margin, neural retina and retinal pigmented epithelium, are specified normally, and the retinal progenitor cells proliferate normally. However, adherens junctions components, including N-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin and filamentous actin, fail to accumulate on the apical side of \u03b1-catenin mutant retinal progenitor cells, where adherens junctions are normally abundant, and the organization of the neural retina and the optic fissure margin is disrupted. Finally, the \u03b1-catenin mutant retina gradually degenerates in the adult mouse eye. Therefore, our results show that \u03b1-catenin-mediated cell adhesion and cell organization are important for the fissure closure in mice, and further suggest that genes that regulate cell adhesion may underlie certain coloboma cases in humans.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-14T21:09:59Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:27:49Z", "id": "511954b3574d45028487e1a5c3783e82", "bibjson": {"author": [{"name": "Juliana Aparecida Souza Amarante"}, {"name": "T\u00e1ssio Dresch Rech"}, {"name": "Ana Emilia Siegloch"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Brazilian Association of Sanitary and Environmental Engineering", "license": [{"url": "http://www.scielo.br/revistas/esa/iaboutj.htm", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "language": ["EN", "PT"], "title": "Engenharia Sanitaria e Ambiental", "country": "BR", "number": "0", "issns": ["1413-4152", "1809-4457"]}, "title": "Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do gerenciamento dos res\u00edduos de medicamentos e demais res\u00edduos de servi\u00e7os de sa\u00fade na Regi\u00e3o Serrana de Santa Catarina", "link": [{"url": "http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1413-41522016005007106&lng=en&tlng=en", "type": "fulltext", "content_type": "html"}], "keywords": ["health care waste", "drugs", "human health", "veterinary"], "identifier": [{"type": "pissn", "id": "1809-4457"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.1590/S1413-41522016150080"}], "abstract": "RESUMO A gest\u00e3o de res\u00edduos dos servi\u00e7os de sa\u00fade (RSS) constitui um grande desafio para o poder p\u00fablico, pois, apesar do avan\u00e7o nos aspectos legislativos, ainda h\u00e1 grandes defici\u00eancias, especialmente relacionadas aos res\u00edduos de medicamentos descartados inadequadamente.

The sensitivity optimized cut-off value was associated with a negative predictive value of 93% compared to 89% provided by application of the 99th percentile threshold.cTnI determined in hemodynamically stable patients with suspected AMI and wide QRS complex using optimized diagnostic thresholds improves rule-in and rule-out with respect to presence of a significant obstructive CAD.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-10T12:56:03Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:27:51Z", "id": "511c60732cf547a388f22433e92ad0fe", "bibjson": {"end_page": "261", "start_page": "247", "author": [{"affiliation": "", "name": "NORBERT SIPOS"}, {"affiliation": "", "name": "GABRIELLA KUR\u00c1TH"}], "abstract": "The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the Hungarian higher education system facing changes since 1990. The three major challenges are: the decreasing number of students enrolling since the \u2018golden age\u2019 ended; the Bologna-Process and its influence since its introduction in 2006 and the uncertainty about the future role of the state in educational finance. The institutions have to take these changes and the effects on their situation into account and they need to find a way to benefit from them. Thanks to Graduate Follow-Up System (GFS) research, they can measure the new graduates performance on the labour-market, their job-related satisfaction levels and possibilities, and furthermore they can have direct information about employers\u2019 expectations, first of all on the level of working skills. This information can be used for the creation of a different approach of how to think about the students and which services could be offered to them. In the following analysis we use data from research conducted in the last three years at the University of P\u00e9cs. The focused energy and resource investment is more effective if it is based on specific training and education packages offered within the Alumni framework.

In Trypanosoma brucei, our laboratory has identified two trypanosome-specific RNA binding proteins P34 and P37 that are involved in the maturation of the 60S subunit during ribosome biogenesis. These proteins are part of the T. brucei 5S ribonucleoprotein particle (5S RNP) and P34 binds to 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal protein L5 through its N-terminus and its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains. We generated truncated P34 proteins to determine these domains' interactions with 5S rRNA and L5. Our analyses demonstrate that RRM1 of P34 mediates the majority of binding with 5S rRNA and the N-terminus together with RRM1 contribute the most to binding with L5. We determined that the consensus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) 1 and 2 sequences, characteristic of canonical RRM domains, are not fully conserved in the RRM domains of P34. However, the aromatic amino acids previously described to mediate base stacking interactions with their RNA target are conserved in both of the RRM domains of P34. Surprisingly, mutation of these aromatic residues did not disrupt but instead enhanced 5S rRNA binding. However, we identified four arginine residues located in RRM1 of P34 that strongly impact L5 binding. These mutational analyses of P34 suggest that the binding site for 5S rRNA and L5 are near each other and specific residues within P34 regulate the formation of the 5S RNP. These studies show the unique way that the domains of P34 mediate binding with the T. brucei 5S RNP.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2017-11-12T01:09:03Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:30:33Z", "id": "51fae95e61a1456cbe4a4c02853220a9", "bibjson": {"end_page": "98", "start_page": "96", "author": [{"affiliation": "Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra, Faculty of Agrobiology and Food Resources, Nitra, Slovakia", "name": "Ivan Imrich "}, {"affiliation": "Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra, Faculty of Agrobiology and Food Resources, Nitra, Slovakia", "name": "Eva Mlynekov\u00e1"}, {"affiliation": "Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra, Faculty of Agrobiology and Food Resources, Nitra, Slovakia", "name": "Juraj Mlynek"}, {"affiliation": "", "name": "J\u00e1n Gurani\u010d"}], "abstract": "In the experiment, we investigated the effect of the hybrid combination and sex on the fattening parameters of pigs fed with the same feed.

To fill this gap we present the TRICLOBS dynamic multi-band image data set containing sixteen registered visual (0.4-0.7\u03bcm), near-infrared (NIR, 0.7-1.0\u03bcm) and long-wave infrared (LWIR, 8-14\u03bcm) motion sequences.

Vehicles, foliage, and buildings or other man-made structures are also included in the scenes. This data set is primarily intended for the development and evaluation of image fusion, enhancement and color mapping algorithms for short-range surveillance applications. The imagery was collected during several field trials with our newly developed TRICLOBS (TRI-band Color Low-light OBServation) all-day all-weather surveillance system. This system registers a scene in the Visual, NIR and LWIR part of the electromagnetic spectrum using three optically aligned sensors (two digital image intensifiers and an uncooled long-wave infrared microbolometer). The three sensor signals are mapped to three individual RGB color channels, digitized, and stored as uncompressed RGB (false) color frames. The TRICLOBS data set enables the development and evaluation of (both static and dynamic) image fusion, enhancement and color mapping algorithms. To allow the development of realistic color remapping procedures, the data set also contains color photographs of each of the three scenes.

Many studies investigated serum UA levels in AD patients, but to date, results from these observational studies are conflicting. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis to compare serum UA levels between AD patients and healthy controls by the random-effects model. Studies were identified by searching PubMed, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library databases from 1966 through July 2013 using the Medical Subject Headings and keywords without restriction in languages. Only case-control studies were included if they had data on serum UA levels in AD patients and healthy controls. Begg's funnel plot and Egger's regression test were applied to assess the potential publication bias. Sensitivity analyses and meta-regression were conducted to explore possible explanations for heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria including 2708 participants were abstracted. Serum UA levels were not significantly different in AD patients compared to healthy controls (standardized mean difference (SMD)\u200a=\u200a-0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.23 to 0.22). Little evidence of publication bias was observed. Sensitivity analyses showed that the combined SMD was consistent every time omitting any one study, except only one study which greatly influenced the overall results. Meta-regression showed that year of publication, race, sample size, and mean age were not significant sources of heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis of case-control studies suggests that serum UA levels do not differ significantly in AD patients, but there may be a trend toward decreased UA in AD after an appropriate interpretation. More well-designed investigations are needed to demonstrate the potential change of serum UA levels in AD patients.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-15T01:43:16Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:30:34Z", "id": "51fcd64e4a05439abfa67af7790acf4b", "bibjson": {"start_page": "e0119706", "author": [{"name": "Shivanand Hegde"}, {"name": "Renate Rosengarten"}, {"name": "Rohini Chopra-Dewasthaly"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Public Library of Science (PLoS)", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "PLoS ONE", "country": "US", "number": "3", "volume": "10", "issns": ["1932-6203"]}, "title": "Disruption of the pdhB pyruvate dehydrogenase [corrected] gene affects colony morphology, in vitro growth and cell invasiveness of Mycoplasma agalactiae.", "month": "0", "link": [{"url": "http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4370745?pdf=render", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2015", "identifier": [{"type": "eissn", "id": "1932-6203"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0119706"}], "abstract": "The utilization of available substrates, the metabolic potential and the growth rates of bacteria can play significant roles in their pathogenicity.

Transposon mutagenesis of M. agalactiae type strain PG2 resulted in several disruptions throughout the genome. A mutant defective in growth in vitro was found to have a transposon insertion in the pdhB gene, which encodes a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This growth difference was quite significant during the actively dividing logarithmic phase but a gradual recovery was observed as the cells approached stationary phase. The mutant also exhibited a different and smaller colony morphology compared to the wild type strain PG2. For complementation, pdhAB was cloned downstream of a strong vpma promoter and upstream of a lacZ reporter gene in a newly constructed complementation vector. When transformed with this vector the pdhB mutant recovered its normal growth and colony morphology. Interestingly, the pdhB mutant also had significantly reduced invasiveness in HeLa cells, as revealed by double immunofluorescence staining. This deficiency was recovered in the complemented strain, which had invasiveness comparable to that of PG2.

Due to the lifetime impact of brain injury, there is a need for methods to stratify patient risk and ultimately predict outcome. Early prognosis is fundamental to the implementation of interventions to improve recovery, but no clinical model as yet exists. Healthy physiology is associated with a relative high variability of physiologic signals in organ systems. This was first evaluated in heart rate variability research. Brain variability can be quantified through electroencephalographic (EEG) phase synchrony. We hypothesised that variability in brain signals from EEG recordings would correlate with patient outcome after brain injury. Lower variability in EEG phase synchronization, would be associated with poor patient prognosis. A retrospective study, spanning 10 years (2000-2010) analysed the scalp EEGs of children aged 1 month to 17 years in coma (Glasgow Coma Scale, GCS, <8) admitted to the paediatric critical care unit (PCCU) following brain injury from TBI, cardiac arrest or stroke. Phase synchrony of the EEGs was evaluated using the Hilbert transform and the variability of the phase synchrony calculated. Outcome was evaluated using the 6 point Paediatric Performance Category Score (PCPC) based on chart review at the time of hospital discharge. Outcome was dichotomized to good outcome (PCPC score 1 to 3) and poor outcome (PCPC score 4 to 6). Children who had a poor outcome following brain injury secondary to cardiac arrest, TBI or stroke, had a higher magnitude of synchrony (R index), a lower spatial complexity of the synchrony patterns and a lower temporal variability of the synchrony index values at 15 Hz when compared to those patients with a good outcome.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-15T01:56:14Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:30:35Z", "id": "51ff945329264482aa7813b8471d2de9", "bibjson": {"start_page": "011015", "author": [{"name": "A.

Various algorithms have been proposed that allow the estimation of self-motion from the optic flow on the eyes. We show that two apparently very different approaches to solve this task, one technically and one biologically inspired, can be transformed into each other under certain conditions. One estimator of self-motion is based on a matched filter approach; it has been developed to describe the function of motion sensitive cells in the fly brain. The other estimator, the Koenderink and van Doorn (KvD) algorithm, was derived analytically with a technical background. If the distances to the objects in the environment can be assumed to be known, the two estimators are linear and equivalent, but are expressed in different mathematical forms. However, for most situations it is unrealistic to assume that the distances are known. Therefore, the depth structure of the environment needs to be determined in parallel to the self-motion parameters and leads to a non-linear problem. It is shown that the standard least mean square approach that is used by the KvD algorithm leads to a biased estimator. We derive a modification of this algorithm in order to remove the bias and demonstrate its improved performance by means of numerical simulations. For self-motion estimation it is beneficial to have a spherical visual field, similar to many flying insects. We show that in this case the representation of the depth structure of the environment derived from the optic flow can be simplified. Based on this result, we develop an adaptive matched filter approach for systems with a nearly spherical visual field. Then only eight parameters about the environment have to be memorized and updated during self-motion.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-10T12:53:28Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:30:57Z", "id": "521bdff1a8204b26beefdcab657e7313", "bibjson": {"end_page": "385", "start_page": "377", "author": [{"name": "Croce D"}, {"name": "Bonfanti M"}, {"name": "Restelli U"}], "abstract": "Davide Croce,1,2 Marzia Bonfanti,1 Umberto Restelli1,2 1Center for Research on Health Economics, Social and Health Care Management, Universit&agrave; Cattaneo, Castellanza, Italy; 2School of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects an estimated number of people between 130 million and 210 million worldwide. In the next few years, the Italian National Health Service will face a growing trend of patients requiring HCV antiviral treatments. The aim of the analysis was to estimate the time horizon in which it would be possible to treat HCV-infected patients and the related direct medical costs (antiviral treatment and monitoring activities) from the Italian National Health Service point of view.Methodology: In order to estimate the number of HCV-infected patients in Italy, we considered a top-down (considering published data) and a bottom-up approach. The number of years needed for treatment and related direct costs were estimated through the development of a static deterministic model.Results: The estimated number of HCV-infected patients in Italy varies from 2.7 (estimated through a top-down approach) to 0.6 million (estimated through a bottom-up approach) and&nbsp;0.3&nbsp;million (measured through a bottom-up approach). Considering the last two scenarios and the use of interferon-free therapies for 50,000 patients per year, treatment for HCV-infected patients could be at a cost of &euro;13.7 billion and &euro;7.0 billion by 2030 and 2023, respectively.Conclusion: The treatment for HCV-infected patients in Italy is a challenging target for the financial implications of patient care.  HCV infection could be controlled or eliminated in a 10- to 15-year time horizon. The cost of treatment can hardly be dealt with using the traditional economic tools but should be faced through multiyear investments, as health benefits are expected in the long period. National Health Service stakeholders (industry, government, insurance, and also patients) will have to identify suitable financial instruments to face the new expenditure required.

Although South Africa has been experiencing an unprecedented influx of refugees since 1994, data on malaria infection among refugees is lacking. Such information is critical since South Africa is among the countries that have planned to eliminate malaria. The objective of this study was to determine prevalence of asymptomatic malaria infection among a refugee population living in a city of KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.A survey was conducted on adult refugee participants who attended a faith-based facility offering social services in a city of KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. The participants were screened for the presence of malaria using rapid diagnostic tests and microscopy. Demographic data for the participants were obtained using a closed ended questionnaire. Data was obtained for 303 participants consisting of 51.5% females and 47.5% males, ranging from 19 to 64 years old. More than 95% of them originated from sub-Saharan African countries. Two hundred and ninety participants provided a blood sample for screening of malaria. Of these, 3.8% tested positive for rapid diagnostic test and 5.9% for microscopy. The majority of malaria infections were due to Plasmodium falciparum.The study confirms the presence of asymptomatic malaria infections among a refugee population residing in a city of KwaZulu-Natal province that is not endemic for malaria. The results have important implications for both public health and malaria control in South Africa, particularly since the country has decided to eliminate malaria by 2018. To achieve this goal, South Africa needs to expand research, surveillance and elimination activities to include non-endemic areas, particularly with high refugee populations.

The prosperity and stability of the community are determined by both the policy of admittance and the attraction of the privileges gained by joining. However, some misbehaving users can get the dedicated resources with some illicit and low-cost approaches, which introduce instability into the community, a phenomenon that will destroy the membership policy. In this paper, we analyze on the stability using game theory on such a phenomenon. We propose a game-theoretical model of stability analysis in community networks and provide conditions for a stable community. We then extend the model to analyze the effectiveness of different incentive policies, which could be used when the community cannot maintain its members in certain situations. Then we verify those models through a simulation. Finally, we discuss several ways to promote community network's stability by adjusting the network's properties and give some proposal on the designs of these types of networks from the points of game theory and stability.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-15T05:06:43Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:30:58Z", "id": "521e2ac0f27b45d49061d75a1e16542a", "bibjson": {"start_page": "75", "author": [{"name": "MAGDA BARROS BIAVASCHI"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo", "language": ["PT", "ES"], "license": [{"url": "http://www.scielo.br/revistas/ea/iaboutj.htm", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY-NC", "title": "CC BY-NC"}], "title": "Estudos Avan\u00e7ados", "country": "BR", "number": "87", "volume": "30", "issns": ["0103-4014", "1806-9592"]}, "title": "O processo de constru\u00e7\u00e3o e desconstru\u00e7\u00e3o da tela de prote\u00e7\u00e3o social do trabalho: tempos de regresso", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Social sciences (General)", "code": "H1-99"}], "link": [{"url": "http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0103-40142016000200075&lng=en&tlng=en", "type": "fulltext", "content_type": "html"}], "keywords": ["Labor law", "Labor justice", "Labor rules", "Outsourcing"], "identifier": [{"type": "pissn", "id": "1806-9592"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.1590/S0103-40142016.30870005"}], "abstract": "resumo O artigo aborda o processo de constru\u00e7\u00e3o do Direito do Trabalho, ramo aut\u00f4nomo do direito fundamentado em princ\u00edpios que s\u00e3o sua raz\u00e3o de ser, cuja g\u00eanese est\u00e1 localizada na Grande ind\u00fastria do s\u00e9culo XIX, em tempos de capitalismo constitu\u00eddo.

Lithium has recently been shown to have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, but its actions in VSMCs and the direct molecular target responsible for its action remains unknown. On the other hand, PGC-1\u03b1 is a transcriptional coactivator which negatively regulates the pathological activation of VSMCs. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to determine if lithium chloride (LiCl) retards VSMC proliferation and migration and if PGC-1\u03b1 mediates the effects of lithium on VSMCs. We found that pretreatment of LiCl increased PGC-1\u03b1 protein expression and nuclear translocation in a dose-dependent manner. MTT and EdU incorporation assays indicated that LiCl inhibited serum-induced VSMC proliferation. Similarly, deceleration of VSMC migration was confirmed by wound healing and transwell assays. LiCl also suppressed ROS generation and cell cycle progression. At the molecular level, LiCl reduced the protein expression levels or phosphorylation of key regulators involved in the cell cycle re-entry, adhesion, inflammation and motility. In addition, in vivo administration of LiCl alleviated the pathophysiological changes in balloon injury-induced neointima hyperplasia. More importantly, knockdown of PGC-1\u03b1 by siRNA significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of LiCl on VSMCs both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that LiCl has great potentials in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases related to VSMC abnormal proliferation and migration. In addition, PGC-1\u03b1 may serve as a promising drug target to regulate cardiovascular physiological homeostasis.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-14T22:09:28Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:30:59Z", "id": "52213195ebda4642adb53352af37e000", "bibjson": {"start_page": "e78639", "author": [{"name": "Ana Paula Junqueira-Kipnis"}, {"name": "F\u00e1bio Muniz de Oliveira"}, {"name": "Monalisa Martins Trentini"}, {"name": "Sangeeta Tiwari"}, {"name": "Bing Chen"}, {"name": "Danilo Pires Resende"}, {"name": "Bruna D S Silva"}, {"name": "Mei Chen"}, {"name": "Lydia Tesfa"}, {"name": "William R Jacobs"}, {"name": "Andr\u00e9 Kipnis"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Public Library of Science (PLoS)", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "PLoS ONE", "country": "US", "number": "11", "volume": "8", "issns": ["1932-6203"]}, "title": "Prime-boost with Mycobacterium smegmatis recombinant vaccine improves protection in mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.", "month": "0", "link": [{"url": "http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3826754?pdf=render", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2013", "identifier": [{"type": "eissn", "id": "1932-6203"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0078639"}], "abstract": "The development of a new vaccine as a substitute for Bacillus Calmette-Guerin or to improve its efficacy is one of the many World Health Organization goals to control tuberculosis. Mycobacterial vectors have been used successfully in the development of vaccines against tuberculosis. To enhance the potential utility of Mycobacterium smegmatis as a vaccine, it was transformed with a recombinant plasmid containing the partial sequences of the genes Ag85c, MPT51, and HspX (CMX) from M. tuberculosis. The newly generated recombinant strain mc(2)-CMX was tested in a murine model of infection. The recombinant vaccine induced specific IgG1 or IgG2a responses to CMX. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from the lungs and spleen responded ex vivo to CMX, producing IFN-\u03b3, IL17, TNF-\u03b1, and IL2. The vaccine thus induced a significant immune response in mice. Mice vaccinated with mc(2)-CMX and challenged with M. tuberculosis showed better protection than mice immunized with wild-type M. smegmatis or BCG. To increase the safety and immunogenicity of the CMX antigens, we used a recombinant strain of M. smegmatis, IKE (immune killing evasion), to express CMX. The recombinant vaccine IKE-CMX induced a better protective response than mc(2)-CMX. The data presented here suggest that the expression of CMX antigens improves the immune response and the protection induced in mice when M. smegmatis is used as vaccine against tuberculosis.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-15T02:27:21Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:30:59Z", "id": "5221591993e64905a4ee11da1e1893ad", "bibjson": {"start_page": "280", "author": [{"name": "Norma M.

At times, a genetic variant may be associated with a master regulator involved in the manifestation of a disease. The downstream target genes of the master regulator are typically co-expressed and share biological function. Therefore, it is practical to screen for eQTLs by identifying SNPs associated with the targets of a transcript-regulator (TR). We used a multivariate regression with the gene expression of known targets of TRs and SNPs to identify TReQTLs in European (CEU) and African (YRI) HapMap populations. A nominal p-value of <1\u00d710(-6) revealed 234 SNPs in CEU and 154 in YRI as TReQTLs. These represent 36 independent (tag) SNPs in CEU and 39 in YRI affecting the downstream targets of 25 and 36 TRs respectively. At a false discovery rate (FDR)\u200a=\u200a45%, one cis-acting tag SNP (within 1 kb of a gene) in each population was identified as a TReQTL. In CEU, the SNP (rs16858621) in Pcnxl2 was found to be associated with the genes regulated by CREM whereas in YRI, the SNP (rs16909324) was linked to the targets of miRNA hsa-miR-125a. To infer the pathways that regulate expression, we ranked TReQTLs by connectivity within the structure of biological process subtrees. One TReQTL SNP (rs3790904) in CEU maps to Lphn2 and is associated (nominal p-value\u200a=\u200a8.1\u00d710(-7)) with the targets of the X-linked breast cancer suppressor Foxp3. The structure of the biological process subtree and a gene interaction network of the TReQTL revealed that tumor necrosis factor, NF-kappaB and variants in G-protein coupled receptors signaling may play a central role as communicators in Foxp3 functional regulation. The potential pleiotropic effect of the Foxp3 TReQTLs was gleaned from integrating mRNA-Seq data and SNP-set enrichment into the analysis.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-15T03:31:04Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:31:01Z", "id": "5224c313bcc8415680e90faed4be74ee", "bibjson": {"end_page": "85", "start_page": "74", "author": [{"name": "Kelsie Gillies"}, {"name": "Jaime Wertman"}, {"name": "Nicholle Charette"}, {"name": "Denis J.

CXCR4 and CCR2 are known to govern cellular processes resulting in cell migration, proliferation and survival. These receptors are expressed at low levels on normal prostate cells and are highly expressed on malignant and metastatic prostate cancer cells. Signaling of these receptors is relatively well understood, but processes governing their expression at the cell membrane are not. PC3 prostate cancer cells were used to demonstrate the importance of various Rab GTPases on cell surface expression and signaling of CXCR4 and CCR2, along with the CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimer. Methods: PC3 prostate cancer cells were transfected with select Rab GTPase wild-type and dominant negative constructs. Effects of each Rab GTPase on endogenous cell surface expression of the individual receptors, along with the overexpressed CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimer, were determined by biotin-streptavidin cell surface assays. These results were corroborated by assessing signal transduction, measured by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation. Conclusion: Rab GTPases required for cell surface expression and signal transduction of CXCR4 or CCR2 differ from those required for the CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimer.

This evolutionary process can complete speciation, thereby providing a direct link between Darwin's theory of natural selection and the origin of new species. Here, by examining a case of speciation by reinforcement in Drosophila,we present the first high-resolution genetic study of variation within species for female mating discrimination that is enhanced by natural selection. We show that reinforced mating discrimination is inherited as a dominant trait, exhibits variability within species, and may be influenced by a known set of candidate genes involved in olfaction. Our results show that the genetics of reinforced mating discrimination is different from the genetics of mating discrimination between species, suggesting that overall mating discrimination might be a composite phenomenon, which in Drosophila could involve both auditory and olfactory cues. Examining the genetics of reinforcement provides a unique opportunity for both understanding the origin of new species in the face of gene flow and identifying the genetic basis of adaptive female species preferences, two major gaps in our understanding of speciation.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Biology (General)", "code": "QH301-705.5"}]}, "created_date": "2005-03-05T00:00:00Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:31:16Z", "id": "5238ba2e536c419db5f468689537649d", "bibjson": {"start_page": "e98674", "author": [{"name": "Nan Zhao"}, {"name": "Nevija Watson"}, {"name": "Zhigang Xu"}, {"name": "Yongjun Chen"}, {"name": "Jenora Waterman"}, {"name": "Jagannathan Sankar"}, {"name": "Donghui Zhu"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Public Library of Science (PLoS)", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "PLoS ONE", "country": "US", "number": "6", "volume": "9", "issns": ["1932-6203"]}, "title": "In vitro biocompatibility and endothelialization of novel magnesium-rare Earth alloys for improved stent applications.", "month": "0", "link": [{"url": "http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4055625?pdf=render", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2014", "identifier": [{"type": "eissn", "id": "1932-6203"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0098674"}], "abstract": "Magnesium (Mg) based alloys are the most advanced cardiovascular stent materials.

Although carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is the most important serum biomarker in pancreatic cancer, the diagnostic and prognostic value of CEA is gradually being recognized.Materials and methods: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched for related literature published until January 2017. Diagnostic accuracy variables were pooled using the Meta-Disc software. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for prognostic data were calculated and analyzed using Stata software.Results: A total of 3,650 participants enrolled in 19 studies met our inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio of a CEA-based panel were 0.45 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41&ndash;0.50), 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86&ndash;0.91), 5.39 (95% CI, 3.16&ndash;9.18), and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.41&ndash;0.72), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC, 0.90) and Q-value (0.84) of the CEA-based panel indicated a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy compared with CEA or CA19-9 alone. Moreover, there was also a significant association between high levels of CEA and worse overall survival (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.31&ndash;1.56).Conclusion: Our meta-analysis indicated that elevated serum CEA level, as a vital supplementary to CA19-9, can play an important role in the clinical diagnosis of pancreatic cancer patients and predict poor prognosis.

The data were statistically analyzed on SPSS-17. Results: Out of a total of 100 patients, 25 and 28 subjects in the low and high help-seeking groups, respectively, were included in the study. In the low help-seeking group, drug compliance was good and caregivers' education level was higher compared to the high help-seeking group. High help-seeking group was characterized by higher scores of hope and compassion on reactions to mental illness scale and the coping mechanisms of humor, denial, use of instrumental and emotional support, acceptance, and planning were frequently used. Conclusions: There is a need to develop awareness about mental illness in the general population and improve the available social support systems to the patients with mental illness and their family members. The help-seeking behaviors could be improved by training the personnel at primary health centers about the treatment of mental illness and importance of drug compliance and regular follow-up.", "end_page": "255"}, "created_date": "2017-09-22T04:24:59Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:31:20Z", "id": "52404595531a44589c01eb31ff1f0188", "bibjson": {"start_page": "e31022", "author": [{"name": "Aron Kos"}, {"name": "Nikkie F M Olde Loohuis"}, {"name": "Martha L Wieczorek"}, {"name": "Jeffrey C Glennon"}, {"name": "Gerard J M Martens"}, {"name": "Sharon M Kolk"}, {"name": "Armaz Aschrafi"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Public Library of Science (PLoS)", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "PLoS ONE", "country": "US", "number": "2", "volume": "7", "issns": ["1932-6203"]}, "title": "A potential regulatory role for intronic microRNA-338-3p for its host gene encoding apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase.", "month": "0", "link": [{"url": "http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3281898?pdf=render", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2012", "identifier": [{"type": "eissn", "id": "1932-6203"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0031022"}], "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important gene regulators that are abundantly expressed in both the developing and adult mammalian brain. These non-coding gene transcripts are involved in post-transcriptional regulatory processes by binding to specific target mRNAs. Approximately one third of known miRNA genes are located within intronic regions of protein coding and non-coding regions, and previous studies have suggested a role for intronic miRNAs as negative feedback regulators of their host genes. In the present study, we monitored the dynamic gene expression changes of the intronic miR-338-3p and miR-338-5p and their host gene Apoptosis-associated Tyrosine Kinase (AATK) during the maturation of rat hippocampal neurons. This revealed an uncorrelated expression pattern of mature miR-338 strands with their host gene. Sequence analysis of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of rat AATK mRNA revealed the presence of two putative binding sites for miR-338-3p. Thus, miR-338-3p may have the capacity to modulate AATK mRNA levels in neurons. Transfection of miR-338-3p mimics into rat B35 neuroblastoma cells resulted in a significant decrease of AATK mRNA levels, while the transfection of synthetic miR-338-5p mimics did not alter AATK levels. Our results point to a possible molecular mechanism by which miR-338-3p participates in the regulation of its host gene by modulating the levels of AATK mRNA, a kinase which plays a role during differentiation, apoptosis and possibly in neuronal degeneration.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-14T19:36:33Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:31:20Z", "id": "5240a683b4e14ce6945373475f9c8d05", "bibjson": {"start_page": "e1000928", "author": [{"name": "Jean-Pierre Vartanian"}, {"name": "Michel Henry"}, {"name": "Agn\u00e8s Marchio"}, {"name": "Rodolphe Susp\u00e8ne"}, {"name": "Marie-Ming Aynaud"}, {"name": "Denise Gu\u00e9tard"}, {"name": "Minerva Cervantes-Gonzalez"}, {"name": "Carlo Battiston"}, {"name": "Vincenzo Mazzaferro"}, {"name": "Pascal Pineau"}, {"name": "Anne Dejean"}, {"name": "Simon Wain-Hobson"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Public Library of Science (PLoS)", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/content-license", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "PLoS Pathogens", "country": "US", "number": "5", "volume": "6", "issns": ["1553-7366", "1553-7374"]}, "title": "Massive APOBEC3 editing of hepatitis B viral DNA in cirrhosis.", "month": "5", "link": [{"url": "http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2877740?pdf=render", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2010", "identifier": [{"type": "eissn", "id": "1553-7374"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.1371/journal.ppat.1000928"}], "abstract": "DNA viruses, retroviruses and hepadnaviruses, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), are vulnerable to genetic editing of single stranded DNA by host cell APOBEC3 (A3) cytidine deaminases. At least three A3 genes are up regulated by interferon-alpha in human hepatocytes while ectopic expression of activation induced deaminase (AICDA), an A3 paralog, has been noted in a variety of chronic inflammatory syndromes including hepatitis C virus infection. Yet virtually all studies of HBV editing have confined themselves to analyses of virions from culture supernatants or serum where the frequency of edited genomes is generally low (< or = 10(-2)). We decided to look at the nature and frequency of HBV editing in cirrhotic samples taken during removal of a primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Forty-one cirrhotic tissue samples (10 alcoholic, 10 HBV(+), 11 HBV(+)HCV(+) and 10 HCV(+)) as well as 4 normal livers were studied. Compared to normal liver, 5/7 APOBEC3 genes were significantly up regulated in the order: HCV+/-HBV>HBV>alcoholic cirrhosis. A3C and A3D were up regulated for all groups while the interferon inducible A3G was over expressed in virus associated cirrhosis, as was AICDA in approximately 50% of these HBV/HCV samples. While AICDA can indeed edit HBV DNA ex vivo, A3G is the dominant deaminase in vivo with up to 35% of HBV genomes being edited. Despite these highly deleterious mutant spectra, a small fraction of genomes survive and contribute to loss of HBeAg antigenemia and possibly HBsAg immune escape. In conclusion, the cytokine storm associated with chronic inflammatory responses to HBV and HCV clearly up regulates a number of A3 genes with A3G clearly being a major restriction factor for HBV. Although the mutant spectrum resulting from A3 editing is highly deleterious, a very small part, notably the lightly edited genomes, might help the virus evolve and even escape immune responses.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Immunologic diseases.

We analyzed four years of capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data on a population of white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, to test whether B. burgdorferi and its tick vector affect the survival of this important reservoir host. We used a multi-state CMR approach to model mouse survival and mouse infection rates as a function of a variety of ecologically relevant explanatory factors. We found no effect of B. burgdorferi infection or tick burden on the survival of P. leucopus. Our estimates of the probability of infection varied by an order of magnitude (0.051 to 0.535) and were consistent with our understanding of Lyme disease in the Northeastern United States. B. burgdorferi establishes a chronic avirulent infection in their rodent reservoir hosts because this pathogen depends on rodent mobility to achieve transmission to its sedentary tick vector. The estimates of B. burgdorferi infection risk will facilitate future theoretical studies on the epidemiology of Lyme disease.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-15T04:37:55Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:31:13Z", "id": "52336ebe9c5d4a66b2513749ae983e42", "bibjson": {"end_page": "392", "start_page": "387", "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Erode Builder Educational Trust Institutions, India", "name": "B.

Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequent use on the Internet. For hiding secret information in images, there exists a large variety of steganographic techniques. The Least Significant Bit (LSB) based approach is a simplest type of steganographic algorithm. In all the existing approaches, the decision of choosing the region within a cover image is performed without considering the relationship between image content and the size of secret message. Thus, the plain regions in the cover will be ruin after data hiding even at a low data rate. Hence choosing the edge region for data hiding will be a solution. Many algorithms are deal with edges in images for data hiding. The Paper 'Edge adaptive image steganography based on LSBMR algorithm' is a LSB steganography presented the results of algorithms on gray-scale images only. This paper presents the results of analyzing the performance of edge adaptive steganography for colored images (JPEG). The algorithms have been slightly modified for colored image implementation and are compared on the basis of evaluation parameters like peak signal noise ratio (PSNR) and mean square error (MSE). This method can select the edge region depending on the length of secret message and difference between two consecutive bits in the cover image. For length of message is short, only small edge regions are utilized while on leaving other region as such. When the data rate increases, more regions can be used adaptively for data hiding by adjusting the parameters. Besides this, the message is encrypted using efficient cryptographic algorithm which further increases the security.", "title": "EFFICIENT ADAPTIVE STEGANOGRAPHY FOR COLOR IMAGESBASED ON LSBMR ALGORITHM", "month": "2", "link": [{"url": "http://ictactjournals.in/paper/IJIVP_Vol2_Iss3_7_Paper_387to392.pdf", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2012", "keywords": ["Least Significant Bit(LSB) Based Steganography", "Pixel Value Difference (PVD)", "Data Embedding", "Data Extraction", "Embedding Unit(EU)", "Vigenere Table"], "identifier": [{"type": "pissn", "id": "0976-9099"}, {"type": "eissn", "id": "0976-9102"}], "journal": {"publisher": "ICT Academy of Tamil Nadu", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://ictactjournals.in/oas.aspx", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY-NC-SA", "title": "CC BY-NC-SA"}], "title": "ICTACT Journal on Image and Video Processing", "country": "IN", "number": "3", "volume": "2", "issns": ["0976-9099", "0976-9102"]}, "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Telecommunication", "code": "TK5101-6720"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Computer applications to medicine.

We aimed to perform the first population-level, integrated analysis of clinical, ECG and hospital characteristics associated with non-receipt of reperfusion therapy in patients with STEMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: This systematic evaluation of STEMI care in 82 hospitals in Quebec included all patients with a discharge diagnosis of myocardial infarction, presenting with characteristic symptoms and an ECG showing STEMI as attested by at least one of two study cardiologists or left bundle branch block (LBBB). Excluding LBBB, an ECG was considered a definite STEMI diagnosis if both cardiologists scored 'certain STEMI' and ambiguous if one scored 'uncertain' or 'not STEMI'. Centers were classified according to accessibility to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI): 1) on-site PPCI; 2) routine transfer for PPCI; 3) varying mix of PPCI transfer and on-site fibrinolysis; and 4) routine on-site fibrinolysis. Of 3730 STEMI/LBBB patients, 812 (21.8%) did not receive reperfusion therapy. In multivariate analysis, likelihood of no reperfusion therapy was a function of PPCI accessibility (odds ratio [OR] for fibrinolysis versus PPCI centers\u200a=\u200a3.1; 95% CI: 2.2-4.4), presence of LBBB (OR\u200a=\u200a24.1; 95% CI: 17.8-32.9) and an ECG ambiguous for STEMI (OR\u200a=\u200a4.1; 95% CI: 3.3-5.1). When the ECG was ambiguous, likelihood of no reperfusion therapy was highest in hospitals most distant from PPCI centers.

Despite over 90 000 \r\nLady Health Workers (LHWs) deployed in Pakistan, whose tasks included management of pneumonia, only 16% of care takers sought care from them for respiratory infections. As part of a community case management trial for childhood pneumonia, community mobilization interventions were implemented to improve care seeking from LHWs in Haripur district, Pakistan. The objective of the study was to increase the number of children receiving treatment for pneumonia and severe pneumonia by Lady Health Workers (LHWs) through community mobilization approaches for prompt recognition and care seeking in 2 to 59 month\u2013old children.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\nTo assess pneumonia care seeking practices, pre and post\u2013\r\nintervention household surveys were conducted in 28 target Union \r\nCouncils. Formative research to improve existing LHW training materials, job aids and other materials was carried out. Advocacy events were organized, LHWs and male health promoters were trained in community mobilization, non\u2013functional women and male health committees were revitalized and LHWs and male health promoters conducted community awareness sessions.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nThe community mobilization interventions were implemented from April 2008 \u2013 December 2009. Project and LHW program staff organized 113 sensitization meetings for opinion leaders, which \r\nwere attended by 2262 males and 3288 females. The 511 trained \r\nLHWs organized 6132 community awareness sessions attended by 50 056 women and 511 male promoters conducted 523 sessions attended by 7845 males. In one year period, the number of LHWs treating pneumonia increased from 11 in April 2008 to 505 in March 2009. The care seeking from LHWs for suspected pneumonia increased from 0.7% in pre\u2013intervention survey to 49.2% in post\u2013intervention survey.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nThe increase in care seeking from LHWs benefited the community through bringing inexpensive appropriate care closer to home and reducing burden on overstretched health facilities. The community mobilization interventions led to improvements in ap\r\n-\r\npropriate care seeking that would not have been achievable just by \r\nstrengthening pneumonia case management skills of LHWs. In addi\r\n-\r\ntion to strengthening skills, community mobilization and behavior \r\nchange activities should also be included in community case manage\r\n-\r\nment programmes.\r\n\r\n", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Public aspects of medicine", "code": "RA1-1270"}]}, "created_date": "2015-07-06T15:15:57Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:30:50Z", "id": "5215cd36c1864b4d92894a8876fdd2d0", "bibjson": {"start_page": "439", "author": [{"affiliation": "Nema", "name": "Monterubbianesi Pablo Daniel"}, {"affiliation": "Nema", "name": "Grandes Mart\u00edn"}, {"affiliation": "Nema", "name": "Dab\u00fas Carlos"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Economists' Association of Vojvodina", "language": ["EN", "FR"], "license": [{"url": "http://doiserbia.nb.rs/journal.aspx?issn=1452-595X&pg=editorialpolicy#Open access policy", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "Panoeconomicus", "country": "RS", "number": "4", "volume": "64", "issns": ["1452-595X", "2217-2386"]}, "title": "New evidence of the health status and economic growth relationship", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Economic theory.

This study was conducted to assess the impact of dizziness/vertigo on the quality of life in the geriatric patients attending a geriatric outpatient clinic. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed in a geriatric outpatient clinic of a rural teaching tertiary care hospital in central India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all consecutive geriatric patients with dizziness/vertigo attending geriatric outpatient clinic, DHI questionnaire was applied to assess the impact of dizziness/vertigo and dizziness associated handicap in the three areas of a patients' life: physical, functional and emotional domain. Later, each patient was evaluated and underwent Dix-Hallpike maneuver by the physician who was blind of the DHI scoring of the patient. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: We compared means and proportions of variables across two categories of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and non-BPPV. For these comparisons we used Student's t-test to test for continuous variables, chi-square test for categorical variables and Fisher's exact test in the case of small cell sizes (expected value<5). RESULTS: The magnitude of dizziness/vertigo was 3%. Of the 88 dizziness/vertigo patients, 19 (22%) and 69(78%) cases, respectively, were attributed to BPPV and non-BPPV group. The association of DHI score \u226550 with the BPPV was found to be statistically significant with x(2) value\u200a=\u200a58.2 at P<0.01. CONCLUSION: DHI Score is a useful tool for the prediction of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Correct diagnosis of BPPV is 16 times greater if the DHI Score is greater than or equal to 50. The physical, functional and emotional investigation of dizziness, through the DHI, has demonstrated to be a valuable and useful instrument in the clinical routine.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-14T22:52:24Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:30:39Z", "id": "5205a38c526d48618d728f137578385b", "bibjson": {"end_page": "179", "start_page": "173", "author": [{"affiliation": "", "name": "S.

In the article the role of soft law in the mechanism of international organizations functioning are shown, the legal nature and impact of these acts on the member states. In our opinion, norms of \"soft law\", as a rule, contained in resolutions of international organizations are non-binding and do not formally bind member states. Norms of \"soft law\" are often adheres by the states and moreover are implemented into the national legal systems by incorporating similar in content standards into the national legislation. This is due to the fact that norms of \"soft law\" has a weight of moral and political significance and, as a rule, are created by organizations that have a considerable authority. Jurists generally distinguish two kinds of acts of recommendatory force: model acts (laws) and recommended acts which are not model, adopted in the framework of international organizations. In this connection the question of each mentioned method influence on the legislation of state. In our opinion, one of distinguishing features of the model recommendatory acts has is quite limited influence on the law of states and a narrow scope.

We collected nasal and saliva samples from 32 vaccinated and 7 unvaccinated FMDV carrier cattle and 48 vaccinated and 13 unvaccinated non-carrier cattle (total n=100) during the acute phase of infection (up to 28 days post-challenge) and then from limited number of animals up to a maximum 168 days post-challenge.

In this study, we identified and characterized two P. endodontalis DPPs, DPP5 and DPP7. Cell-associated DPP activity toward Lys-Ala-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA) was prominent in P. endodontalis ATCC 35406 as compared with the Porphyromonas gingivalis strains ATCC 33277, 16-1, HW24D1, ATCC 49417, W83, W50, and HNA99.

Recombinant MER236725 exhibited enzymatic properties including substrate specificity, and salt- and pH-dependence similar to P. gingivalis DPP5 belonging to the S9 family. However, the kcat/Km figure (194 \u00b5M-1\u00b7sec-1) for the most potent substrate (Lys-Ala-MCA) was 18.4-fold higher as compared to the P. gingivalis entity (10.5 \u00b5M-1\u00b7sec-1).

While IL-33 was significantly up-regulated in the epithelium for CRSsNP, its receptor was higher expressed in sinus tissue from CRSwNP.The present study delineates the influence of IL-33 in upper airway epithelium and a potential role of IL-33 in chronic inflammation of CRSwNP by enhancing Th2 type cytokine production, which could both contribute to a further increase of an established Th2 profile in CRSwNP.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-15T04:51:48Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:31:02Z", "id": "5225dce3a83f4bb39600ecd337b83fd6", "bibjson": {"end_page": "82", "start_page": "79", "author": [{"affiliation": "\u0412\u0414\u041d\u0417 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u00ab\u0411\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u00bb, \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0446\u0456 (\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430)", "name": "\u041b\u0456\u0434\u0456\u044f \u0412\u0418\u041b\u041a\u0410"}], "abstract": "\u0412\u0438\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u041b\u0438\u0434\u0438\u044f. \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430: \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u044f \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430.\r\n\u0412 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u041d. \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430.\r\n\u0421\u043e\u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044e \u0438 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044e \u0445\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0433\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u043e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0411\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0439. \u0423 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445\r\n\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u041d. \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0430\u043a\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\r\n\u00ab\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430.\r\n\u041a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430:\r\n\u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c,\r\n\u0444\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c,\r\n\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f,\r\n\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e-\u041c\u0435\u0444\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435\r\n\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e.\r\nVylka L. The Faith of Christ as the Foundation of Law:\r\nReligion in the Life and Creative Activity of Mykola\r\nKostomarov. This article explores the role of religion in the\r\nlife and creative activity of M. Kostomarov. The author focuses\r\nupon the fact that the distinguished writer and the prominent\r\nscholar exposed \u0430 detailed erudition in the questions of history\r\nand philosophy of Christian doctrine. The article presents facts\r\nand arguments which show that M. Kostomarov considered the\r\nlaw of God with deep understanding and piety. In his writings\r\nM. Kostomarov stressed upon the idea that each Slavic people\r\nshould endeavor to make \u00abthe faith of Christ the basis of their\r\nState law\u00bb. According to his position within the sphere of education, there should be superiority of the spiritual over the material, the only precondition which could make it possible to\r\nachieve this goal was that education should be conducted in the\r\nOrthodox-Christian spirit, which has always been the foundation of moral power of the Ukrainian people.\r\nThe article pays special attention to publications by\r\nM. Kostomarov giving historical evidence of religiousness of\r\nUkrainian people as a phenomenon coming out of a deep spiritual culture of this nation. The scientist stressed upon the fact\r\nthat in the case of the people of Russ \u00abIt was Christianity, and\r\nonly Christianity that gave the true and solid foundation for the\r\nfurther elaboration of civil and political life \u2013 principles without which, no nation has its history\u00bb.\r\nThe scientist\u2019s Conclusions concerning Ukrainians\u2019 religious faith as one of the most brilliant signs of their spirituality\r\nhave been undisputed up to our times. The article investigates\r\nthe valuable conclusion to which the famous historian arrives:\r\nUkrainian religious belief is deeply rooted in many factors and\r\ncircumstances, and that is valuable not \u00abonly for ourselves but\r\nfor other people\u00bb. In fact, it was a statement of the highest quality of religious background of the whole national culture.\r\nComparing the Ukrainian historiosophist\u2019s thoughts with\r\nthe Bible, we may conclude that the author of \u00abBooks of being\u00bb\r\nwas an ardent confessor of Scripture. As a believer and a convicted defender of the Church M. Kostomarov was convinced\r\nthat religion \u2013 is not only a relationship with God, but also a\r\nrelationship of person with other persons that is an organic\r\ncomponent of Orthodox doctrine of Catholicity(Sobornist). In\r\naccordance with orthodox doctrine M. Kostomarov consideres\r\nbelief and behavior, religion and historicity as closely interrelated.\r\nKey words: European romanticism, philosophical trends,\r\nrational cognition, confessionalizm, religious trends, the CyrilMefodious brotherhood.", "title": "\u0412\u0406\u0420\u0410 \u0425\u0420\u0418\u0421\u0422\u041e\u0412\u0410 \u042f\u041a \u041e\u0421\u041d\u041e\u0412\u0410 \u0417\u0410\u041a\u041e\u041d\u0423: \u0420\u0415\u041b\u0406\u0413\u0406\u042f \u0412 \u0416\u0418\u0422\u0422\u0406 \u0406 \u0422\u0412\u041e\u0420\u0427\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0406 \u041c\u0418\u041a\u041e\u041b\u0418 \u041a\u041e\u0421\u0422\u041e\u041c\u0410\u0420\u041e\u0412\u0410 / THE FAITH OF CHRIST AS THE FOUNDATION OF LAW: RELIGION IN THE LIFE AND CREATIVE ACTIVITY OF MYKOLA KOSTOMAROV", "month": "12", "link": [{"url": "https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=YnNtdS5lZHUudWF8YXBzbmltfGd4OmMzNGI4ODA5MWNhY2VhZA", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2016", "keywords": ["European romanticism", "philosophical trends", "rational cognition", "confessionalizm", "religious trends", "the CyrilMefodious brotherhood", "\u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c", "\u0444\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f", "\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f", "\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c", "\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f", "\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e-\u041c\u0435\u0444\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e"], "identifier": [{"type": "pissn", "id": "2311-9896"}, {"type": "eissn", "id": "2411-6181"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Bukovinian  State Medical university", "license": [{"url": "http://apsnim.bsmu.edu.ua/home", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY-SA", "title": "CC BY-SA"}], "language": ["EN", "FR", "RU", "UK"], "title": "Aktual\u02b9n\u00ec Pitann\u00e2 Susp\u00ecl\u02b9nih Nauk ta Istor\u00ec\u00ef Medicini", "country": "UA", "number": "4(12)", "issns": ["2311-9896", "2411-6181"]}, "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "History of medicine.

To overcome the dose-limiting toxicity of doxorubicin (DOX), a sulfatide-containing nanoliposome (SCN) encapsulation approach was employed to improve treatment efficacy and reduce side effects of free DOX. This study analysed in vitro characteristics of sulfatide-containing nanoliposomal DOX (SCN-DOX) and assessed its cytotoxicity in vitro, as well as biodistribution, therapeutic efficacy, and systemic toxicity in a human glioblastoma U-118MG xenograft model. SCN-DOX was shown to achieve highest drug to lipid ratio (0.5\u22361) and a remarkable in vitro stability. Moreover, DOX encapsulated in SCN was shown to be delivered into the nuclei and displayed prolonged retention over free DOX in U-118MG cells. This simple two-lipid SCN-DOX nanodrug has favourable pharmacokinetic attributes in terms of prolonged circulation time, reduced volume of distribution and enhanced bioavailability in healthy rats. As a result of the improved biodistribution, an enhanced treatment efficacy of SCN-DOX was found in glioma-bearing mice compared to the free drug. Finally, a reduction in the accumulation of DOX in the drug's principal toxicity organs achieved by SCN-DOX led to the diminished systemic toxicity as evident from the plasma biochemical analyses. Thus, SCN has the potential to be an effective and safer nano-carrier for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to tumors with elevated expression of tenascin-C in their microenvironment.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-15T04:14:23Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:31:04Z", "id": "522808284b044d5eb428e68e098b1806", "bibjson": {"start_page": "e103341", "author": [{"name": "Daniel Botman"}, {"name": "Eric R\u00f6ttinger"}, {"name": "Mark Q Martindale"}, {"name": "Johann de Jong"}, {"name": "Jaap A Kaandorp"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Public Library of Science (PLoS)", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "PLoS ONE", "country": "US", "number": "7", "volume": "9", "issns": ["1932-6203"]}, "title": "A computational approach towards a gene regulatory network for the developing Nematostella vectensis gut.", "month": "0", "link": [{"url": "http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4116165?pdf=render", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2014", "identifier": [{"type": "eissn", "id": "1932-6203"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0103341"}], "abstract": "The starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis is a diploblastic cnidarian that expresses a set of conserved genes for gut formation during its early development. During the last decade, the spatial distribution of many of these genes has been visualized with RNA hybridization or protein immunolocalization techniques. However, due to N. vectensis' curved and changing morphology, quantification of these spatial data is problematic. A method is developed for two-dimensional gene expression quantification, which enables a numerical analysis and dynamic modeling of these spatial patterns.In this work, first standardized gene expression profiles are generated from publicly available N. vectensis embryo images that display mRNA and/or protein distributions. Then, genes expressed during gut formation are clustered based on their expression profiles, and further grouped based on temporal appearance of their gene products in embryonic development.

This scheme iteratively fits simulated profiles to the selected profiles, leading to an optimized estimation of the model parameters.

However, there is limited information on how fire and recovery from this disturbance affects spatial variation in Rs. The main objective of this study was to quantify the spatial variability of Rs over the growing season in a boreal aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) fire chronosequence. The chronosequence included three stands in northern Alberta; a post fire stand (1 year old, PF), a stand at canopy closure (9 years old, CC), and a mature stand (72 years old, MA). Soil respiration, temperature and moisture were measured monthly from May to August using an intensive spatial sampling protocol (n = 42, minimum lag = 2 m). Key aboveground and belowground properties were measured one time at each sampling point. No spatial structure was detected in Rs of the PF stand during the peak growing season (June and July), whereas Rs was auto-correlated at a scale of < 6 m in the CC and MA stands. The PF stand had the lowest mean Rs (4.60 \u03bcmol C m-2 s-1) followed by the CC (5.41 \u03bcmol C m-2 s-1), and the MA (7.32 \u03bcmol C m-2 s-1) stand. Forest floor depth was the only aboveground factor that influenced the spatial pattern of Rs in all three stands and was strongest in the PF stand. Enzyme activity and fine root biomass, on the other hand, were the significant belowground factors driving the spatial pattern of Rs in the CC and MA stands. Persistent joint aboveground and belowground control on Rs in the CC and MA stands indicates a tight spatial coupling, which was not observed in the PF stand. Overall, the current study suggests that fire in the boreal aspen ecosystem alters the spatial structure of Rs and that fine scale heterogeneity develops quickly as stands reach the canopy closure phase (<10 years).", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2017-11-11T22:31:24Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:31:06Z", "id": "522c63ff856b4d928d25722ee3d977d6", "bibjson": {"start_page": "e60160", "author": [{"name": "Anubha Sagar"}, {"name": "Carolin Klemm"}, {"name": "Lara Hartjes"}, {"name": "Stefanie Mauerer"}, {"name": "Ger van Zandbergen"}, {"name": "Barbara Spellerberg"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Public Library of Science (PLoS)", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "PLoS ONE", "country": "US", "number": "4", "volume": "8", "issns": ["1932-6203"]}, "title": "The \u03b2-hemolysin and intracellular survival of Streptococcus agalactiae in human macrophages.", "month": "0", "link": [{"url": "http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3617175?pdf=render", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2013", "identifier": [{"type": "eissn", "id": "1932-6203"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0060160"}], "abstract": "S. agalactiae (group B streptococci, GBS) is a major microbial pathogen in human neonates and causes invasive infections in pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals.

To examine the role of \u03b2-hemolysin in the interaction with professional phagocytes, the THP-1 monocytic cell line and human granulocytes were infected with a serotype Ia S. agalactiae wild type strain and its isogenic nonhemolytic mutant. We could show that the nonhemolytic mutants were able to survive in significantly higher numbers than the hemolytic wild type strain, in THP-1 macrophage-like cells and in assays with human granulocytes.

The hemolytic wild type strain stimulated a significantly higher release of Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 than the nonhemolytic mutant in THP-1 cells, while similar levels of the chemokine Interleukin-8 were induced. In order to investigate bacterial mediators of IL-8 release in this setting, purified cell wall preparations from both strains were tested and found to exert a potent proinflammatory stimulus on THP-1 cells.

One of the\r\nimportant aspects of this environment is financialization, which is considered to be the most significant socioeconomic\r\nphenomenon characteristic of capitalism. The aim of this paper is to discuss the effect of financialization on\r\nthe attitudes of psychotherapists and on the quality of care they provide. Discussion: The paper presents a theoretical\r\nanalysis of the relationship between the primary constituents of the therapeutic relationship (i.e. trust, realness,\r\nindividuality of approach, honesty, truth, ethics, the good of the patient) and the phenomena characteristic of the\r\nprocess of financialization (such as replacement of relationship for transaction, distrust, advertisement, statistics,\r\nprofitability, acceptance of a lie, relativism, consumptionism, perception of own benefits). Summary: Financialization\r\ncan change the therapeutic relationship through indiscriminate introjection of financialization by the therapist.\r\nThe primary cognitive and behavioural effect of this process is a shift in the proportions between the foundations\r\nof therapeutic relationship towards the foundations of financialization (as defined in this article). To the best of our\r\nknowledge, this is the first article presenting the correlation between financialization and psychotherapy.", "title": "Financialization may affect the\u00a0therapeutic relationship in\u00a0psychotherapy", "month": "4", "link": [{"url": "http://www.psychiatria.com.pl/index.php/wydawnictwa/2015-vol-15-no-1/financialization-may-affect-the-therapeutic-relationship-in-psychotherapy?aid=501", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2015", "keywords": ["financialization", "therapeutic relationship", "culture and psychotherapy", "professional ethics in psychotherapy"], "identifier": [{"type": "doi", "id": "10.15557/PiPK.2015.0002"}, {"type": "pissn", "id": "1644-6313"}, {"type": "eissn", "id": "2451-0645"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Medical Communications Sp. z o.o.", "language": ["EN", "PL"], "license": [{"url": "http://www.psychiatria.com.pl/dev.php/instructions-for-authors#Copyright", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY-NC-ND", "title": "CC BY-NC-ND"}], "title": "Psychiatria i Psychologia Kliniczna", "country": "PL", "number": "1", "volume": "15", "issns": ["1644-6313", "2451-0645"]}, "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}]}, "created_date": "2017-06-14T09:49:00Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:31:25Z", "id": "5246d6e4919d42e690fdfef23b6c2324", "bibjson": {"start_page": "e1000107", "author": [{"name": "Marc C Levesque"}, {"name": "M Anthony Moody"}, {"name": "Kwan-Ki Hwang"}, {"name": "Dawn J Marshall"}, {"name": "John F Whitesides"}, {"name": "Joshua D Amos"}, {"name": "Thaddeus C Gurley"}, {"name": "Sallie Allgood"}, {"name": "Benjamin B Haynes"}, {"name": "Nathan A Vandergrift"}, {"name": "Steven Plonk"}, {"name": "Daniel C Parker"}, {"name": "Myron S Cohen"}, {"name": "Georgia D Tomaras"}, {"name": "Paul A Goepfert"}, {"name": "George M Shaw"}, {"name": "J\u00f6rn E Schmitz"}, {"name": "Joseph J Eron"}, {"name": "Nicholas J Shaheen"}, {"name": "Charles B Hicks"}, {"name": "Hua-Xin Liao"}, {"name": "Martin Markowitz"}, {"name": "Garnett Kelsoe"}, {"name": "David M Margolis"}, {"name": "Barton F Haynes"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Public Library of Science (PLoS)", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/content-license", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "PLoS Medicine", "country": "US", "number": "7", "volume": "6", "issns": ["1549-1277", "1549-1676"]}, "title": "Polyclonal B cell differentiation and loss of gastrointestinal tract germinal centers in the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection.", "month": "7", "link": [{"url": "http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2702159?pdf=render", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2009", "identifier": [{"type": "pissn", "id": "1549-1277"}, {"type": "eissn", "id": "1549-1676"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.1371/journal.pmed.1000107"}], "abstract": "The antibody response to HIV-1 does not appear in the plasma until approximately 2-5 weeks after transmission, and neutralizing antibodies to autologous HIV-1 generally do not become detectable until 12 weeks or more after transmission. Moreover, levels of HIV-1-specific antibodies decline on antiretroviral treatment. The mechanisms of this delay in the appearance of anti-HIV-1 antibodies and of their subsequent rapid decline are not known. While the effect of HIV-1 on depletion of gut CD4(+) T cells in acute HIV-1 infection is well described, we studied blood and tissue B cells soon after infection to determine the effect of early HIV-1 on these cells.In human participants, we analyzed B cells in blood as early as 17 days after HIV-1 infection, and in terminal ileum inductive and effector microenvironments beginning at 47 days after infection. We found that HIV-1 infection rapidly induced polyclonal activation and terminal differentiation of B cells in blood and in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) B cells. The specificities of antibodies produced by GALT memory B cells in acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) included not only HIV-1-specific antibodies, but also influenza-specific and autoreactive antibodies, indicating very early onset of HIV-1-induced polyclonal B cell activation. Follicular damage or germinal center loss in terminal ileum Peyer's patches was seen with 88% of follicles exhibiting B or T cell apoptosis and follicular lysis.Early induction of polyclonal B cell differentiation, coupled with follicular damage and germinal center loss soon after HIV-1 infection, may explain both the high rate of decline in HIV-1-induced antibody responses and the delay in plasma antibody responses to HIV-1.

The aim of this study was to investigate and characterise tumour-propagating cell (TPC) compartments within human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).After long-term culture, we identified three morphologically different tumour cell populations in a single HCC specimen, and extensively characterised them by means of flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, karyotyping and microarray analyses, single cell cloning, and xenotransplantation in NOD/SCID/IL2R\u03b3/\u207b mice.The primary cell populations (hcc-1, -2 and -3) and two clones generated by means of limiting dilutions from hcc-1 (clone-1/7 and -1/8) differently expressed a number of tumour-associated stem cell markers, including EpCAM, CD49f, CD44, CD133, CD56, Thy-1, ALDH and CK19, and also showed different doubling times, drug resistance and tumorigenic potential. Moreover, we found that ALDH expression, in combination with CD44 or Thy-1 negativity or CD56 positivity identified subpopulations with a higher clonogenic potential within hcc-1, hcc-2 and hcc-3 primary cell populations, respectively. Karyotyping revealed the clonal evolution of the cell populations and clones within the primary tumour. Importantly, the primary tumour cell population with the greatest tumorigenic potential and drug resistance showed more chromosomal alterations than the others and contained clones with epithelial and mesenchymal features.Individual HCCs can harbor different self-renewing tumorigenic cell types expressing a variety of morphological and phenotypical markers, karyotypic evolution and different gene expression profiles. This suggests that the models of hepatic carcinogenesis should take into account TPC heterogeneity due to intratumour clonal evolution.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2016-06-14T20:21:51Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:31:26Z", "id": "524818f3c87340aa97a6d58e2d1530ef", "bibjson": {"start_page": "e0171590", "author": [{"name": "Lucas Wetzel"}, {"name": "David J J\u00f6rg"}, {"name": "Alexandros Pollakis"}, {"name": "Wolfgang Rave"}, {"name": "Gerhard Fettweis"}, {"name": "Frank J\u00fclicher"}], "journal": {"publisher": "Public Library of Science (PLoS)", "language": ["EN"], "license": [{"url": "http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/content-license", "open_access": true, "type": "CC BY", "title": "CC BY"}], "title": "PLoS ONE", "country": "US", "number": "2", "volume": "12", "issns": ["1932-6203"]}, "title": "Self-organized synchronization of digital phase-locked loops with delayed coupling in theory and experiment.", "month": "0", "link": [{"url": "http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5312960?pdf=render", "type": "fulltext"}], "year": "2017", "identifier": [{"type": "eissn", "id": "1932-6203"}, {"type": "doi", "id": "10.1371/journal.pone.0171590"}], "abstract": "Self-organized synchronization occurs in a variety of natural and technical systems but has so far only attracted limited attention as an engineering principle.

Here we show how the self-organized synchronization of mutually coupled digital phase-locked loops (DPLLs) can provide robust clocking in large-scale systems. We develop a nonlinear phase description of individual and coupled DPLLs that takes into account filter impulse responses and delayed signal transmission. Our phase model permits analytical expressions for the collective frequencies of synchronized states, the analysis of stability properties and the time scale of synchronization. In particular, we find that signal filtering introduces stability transitions that are not found in systems without filtering. To test our theoretical predictions, we designed and carried out experiments using networks of off-the-shelf DPLL integrated circuitry. We show that the phase model can quantitatively predict the existence, frequency, and stability of synchronized states. Our results demonstrate that mutually delay-coupled DPLLs can provide robust and self-organized synchronous clocking in electronic systems.", "subject": [{"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Medicine", "code": "R"}, {"scheme": "LCC", "term": "Science", "code": "Q"}]}, "created_date": "2017-11-12T00:39:08Z"}, {"last_updated": "2017-12-11T19:30:42Z", "id": "5209d58fb52a408f8e753e75c8ee5056", "bibjson": {"end_page": "71", "start_page": "67", "author": [{"affiliation": "\nFederal University of Vi\u00e7osa\n", "name": "Newton Paulo Bueno"}], "abstract": "While growing attention has been paid to the idea of resilience of social-ecological systems, it seems that there still are a number of gaps to bridge before we could really use this concept for practical purposes.
